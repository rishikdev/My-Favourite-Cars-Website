# My Favourite Cars Website
A website developed using the following technologies:
  - JavaScript
  - JQuery
  - PHP
  - HTML
  - CSS
  - Blender (for 3D renders)
  - SQL
  - Bootstrap

All the 3D renders of the car models were done using Blender.

I have updated the homepage to look more inline with the current theme of neomorphism (achieved using CSS).
